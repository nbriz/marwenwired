				<br><br>
				<br>

				<p>
					the course is over :( ...but your creative-code net-art practice is only just beginning :), all your files will be saved in “the cloud” ( ie. the class server ). Our server is physically located somewhere in NYC, but can be accessed from anywhere using cyberduck ( here’s a link to day 3 notes if you ever forget how ). cyberduck ( like all the tools we’ve used in class ) is free to download ( for windows + mac ) so u can log onto your website from home and download all you files to your home computer, work on them locally ( on your machine ) with sublime ( which you can also download for windows + mac + linux ) and when you make any changes ( or something new ) use cyberduck to get it uploaded back onto your website!
					<br><br>
					here’s a list of the tools we’ve been using in class and where you can download them

				<h2> where to go from here? </h2>
				<br><br>

				<p>
					there's libraries, templates and code-snippets for everything out there ...<br><br>
					<blockquote>

						<p>
						...But you need to know how to find them [and] what they are called. Code isn't just obscure commands in a file. it requires you to have a map in your head, to know where the good libraries, the best documentation, and the most helpful message boards are located. If you don't know where those things are, you will spend all of your time searching, instead of building cool new things" &mdash; <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/" target="_blank">Paul Ford</a>
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<br><br>
				</p>

				<p>

					there’s so much more to learn! some of you might be interested in cleaning up your home pages. there’s a great tutorial series called “<a href="http://www.dontfeartheinternet.com/" target="_blank">Don't Fear the Internet</a>” which goes through HTML && CSS web design in a few short videos. I strongly suggest watching all of those if you want to get your web skills strong. if your the kind of person that prefers learning from books then i strongly recommend the book <a href="http://www.htmlandcssbook.com/" target="_blank">HTML & CSS</a> by John Duckett<br><br>

					if you want to dive deeper in to JavaScript, there’s SO MUCH more to learn :D, again if you like books John Duckett’s got one for JavaScript too called <a href="http://javascriptbook.com/" target="_blank">JavaScript & JQuery</a>. another great JavaScript book ( for those of you who want to master the language ) is <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/" target="_blank">Eloquent JavaScript</a> ( you can buy it in paper but there’s an online version of the whole book here ). <br><br>

					while your working on your website and/or net art there’s a few websites that have great references. <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">w3schools</a> has all the info you could ever want on every HTML tag. <a href="https://css-tricks.com/almanac/" target="_blank">CSS-Tricks</a> has a great reference for all the CSS properties ( as well as lots of cool css tricks as the name implies ) and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript" target="_blank">Mozilla</a> ( the foundation that makes the firefox browser ) has some beautifully organized resources on JavaScript. Also if you ever get stuck trying to figure something out you should check out the site <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">StackOverflow</a>. it’s a forum where folks ask coding questions and other people answer them. there’s a good chance someone has asked your question before ( and if not, you can ask it yourself :) >> people can be super nice and also super mean on forums, it’s important to follow the rules of any community before jumping in. on StackOverflow, when asking a question here’s a couple rules to keep in mind ( and if you do, lots of friendly people will quickly answer your question )<br><br>
				</p>
				<ol>
						<li>make sure no one else has already asked the question ( search the site and see )</li>
						<li>make sure the question you are asking is clear and includes the code you’re having issue with</li>
						<li>don’t copy all of your code! just the part you’re having trouble with</li>
						<li>if someone answers the question right, mark it as “correct” ( they appreciate it cause they get points, but also it lets other people know which is the right answer )</li>
					</ol><br><br>
				<p>

					when all else fails, i’m only an email away ( n<span></span>ick<span></span>bri<span></span>z@gm<span></span>ail.c<span></span>om ) don’t hesitate to send me an email if you have any questions about the Internet, or if you want to send me any cool net art your making :)

				<h2> renewing your website ( 1 year from now ) </h2><br><br>

				<p>
					<b>BE WARNED!</b> your domain name is only registered to you for 1 year! you will have to pay to renew it ( somewhere around $10-$12 ) yourself every year. similarly, our server will only be up and running for 1 year! so you will have to transfer your files to a new server if you want to keep your website up for after a year. the steps below will walk you through the process of renewing + transferring <br><br>
				</p><br><br>

				
				<div class="row clearfix">
				    <div class="column full"> 
				    	<p>
				    		<b>step 1</b> your current domain is registered through a company called <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/" target="_blank">namecheap</a>, you can visit their <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/" target="_blank">website</a> and sign into your account. your username is your first name + wired ( so for example zac’s user name is zacwired, mecca’s user name is meccawired … there’s one exception, evanwired was already taken so evan’s user name is evanwired1 ) then use your ftp password ( the one you made in class ) to log in. 
				    	</p>	
				    </div>			    
				</div><br><br><br>

				<div class="row clearfix">
				    <div class="column third"> 
				    	<p>
				    		<b>step 2</b> the marwen server will go down in a year, but you can move your website to one of namecheap’s servers ( the company you pay for server space is usually called your “host” ). once you are logged in click on “Shared Hosting” in the “Hosting” menu. 
				    	</p>	
				    </div>
				    <div class="column two-thirds"> 
				    	<img src="images/namecheap2.png" class="rwd">
				    </div>				    
				</div><br><br><br>

				<div class="row clearfix">
				    <div class="column full"> 
				    	<p>
				    		<b>step 3</b> there are lots of different payment options. you’ll need a credit card ( or other digital payment method ) to purchase a year of hosting, so if you don’t have your own you’ll likely need your parent/guardian’s help for this part. choose a plan that seems right for you.
				    	</p>	
				    </div>				    			   
				</div><br><br><br>

				<div class="row clearfix">
				    <div class="column third"> 
				    	<p>
				    		<b>step 4</b> once you pick a plan you’ll see this window. choose the “use a domain i own with namecheap” option. on the next page you should see your domain name. click the SELECT button beside your domain. 
				    	</p>	
				    </div>
				    <div class="column two-thirds"> 
				    	<img src="images/namecheap1.png" class="rwd">
				    </div>				    
				</div><br><br><br>

				<div class="row clearfix">
				    <div class="column full"> 
				    	<p>
				    		<b>step 5</b> when you finish and pay, you should now be able to log onto your website using cyberduck as always ( the only difference is that your website will now be “hosted” on namecheap’s servers instead of the marwen server ). if you have any issues logging in you can chat with a customer service rep on namecheap’s website ( they’re very helpful, i’ve chatted with them before )
