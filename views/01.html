				    		motivated by similar research goals, an engineer named Paul Baran developed two key ideas which would be central to the Internet, the first was building a “distributed” network, a network with no center, where no one node is more important than the other. the second idea is what came to be known as “packet-switching”, whereby files would be divided into smaller pieces ( or packets ) and individually ( and thus more efficiently ) sent across the network and pieced back together on the receiving end.  these were radical ideas at the time which stood in stark contrast to the methods and ideologies of the established communication monopoly ( AT&T ).
				    	</p>
				    	<br><br><br>
				    	<blockquote><p>
							"The older telephone engineers had problems with the concept of packet switching. On one of my several trips to AT&T Headquarters at 195 Broadway in New York City I tried to explainpacket switching to a senior telephone company executive. In mid sentence he interrupted me, “Wait a minute, son. “Are you trying to tell me that you open the switch before the signal is transmitted all the way across the country?” I said, “Yes sir, that’s right.” The old analog engineer looked stunned. He looked at his colleagues in the room while his eyeballs rolled up sending a signal of his utter disbelief. He paused for a while, and then said, “Son, here’s how a telephone works….” And then he went on with a patronizing explanation of how a carbon button telephone worked. It was a conceptual impasse."

In the 60’s they funded the development of a computer network which would achieve the aforementioned research goals as well ensure communication in the aftermath of a nuclear attack. This became the ARPANET</p>

				    	With the standardization of TCP/IP came the real possibility to connect the ARPANET with other international networks and create a “network of networks” each controlled by different organizations but all following the same rules and protocols to form the Internet. In the 80’s the military handed over the ARPANET to the National Science Foundation, who then built the first “Internet backbone”, a high-speed network that connected different parts of the Internet together.

				    	former US vice-president Al Gore may have misspoken when he said he “took the initiative in creating the Internet” but what he was referring to was the work he and the Clinton Administration did to expand Internet usage beyond the academic niche. He wrote essays on the subject including “Infrastructure for a Global Village” and pushed granting initiatives that lead to the National Information Infrastructure and the first popular graphical web browser ( Mosaic ). In 1994 the commercial restrictions were lifted when the Clinton Administration privatized the backbone.

				    	Today, no single institution controls the Internet. There are thousands of commercial companies, non-for profits, universities, governments, public interest groups and other entities who play different roles in controlling and maintaining the Internet. The many backbones ( or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tier_1_network#List_of_tier_1_networks" target="_blank">Tier 1 networks</a> ) are maintained by different companies and interconnect to each other to exchange traffic ( at <a href="http://www.internetexchangemap.com/#/" target="_blank">Internet exchange points</a> ) on a voluntary ( surprisingly informal ) basis. There are a handful of international not-for-profit organizations like the IETF (<a href="http://www.ietf.org/" target="_blank">Internet Engineering Task Force</a>) and ICANN (<a href="https://www.icann.org/" target="_blank">Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers</a>) which develop and maintain the Internet’s standards and conventions, many of which are open for anyone to join and participate in.

					lots of folks confuse the World Wibe Web with the Internet, but they are in fact two different things. confusing the two would be like confusing cars for roads. the Web is one of the many things we use the Internet for, in the same way that cars are one of the many vehicles that travel on roads.
